    Context: A preliminary overall Business Stability Score of {stability_score} has been assigned to this company based on the transcript below.
    
    Instruction: Analyze the following financial transcript to identify drivers of perceived business stability and risk profile. 
    Your analysis should be consistent with and help explain the overall stability score of {stability_score}.
    
    Drivers for Classification:
1. Macro-Environmental Conditions
•	Definition: "The external economic and geopolitical climate supports business growth, characterized by stable inflation, favorable exchange rates, and open trade borders."
•	Classify on a scale from +2 (Tailwinds/Stable) to -2 (Severe Headwinds): Based on references to inflation, interest rates, geopolitics (e.g., China relations, war), or FX impacts.
•	Examples: "+2: FX tailwinds boosting revenue", "-2: High inflation and lockdowns in China hurting sales".
2. Supply Chain Integrity
•	Definition: "The ability to source raw materials and transport products efficiently, with minimal delays, shortages, or logistical cost spikes."
•	Classify on a scale from +2 (Seamless/Optimized) to -2 (Disrupted/Constrained): Based on lead times, material availability, and logistics costs.
•	Examples: "+2: Supply chain normalizing", "-2: Severe shortages of electronic components".
3. Manufacturing & Regulatory Quality
•	Definition: "Operations run at required capacity with full regulatory compliance, ensuring products meet quality standards without remediation needs."
•	Classify on a scale from +2 (Capacity expanded/Compliant) to -2 (Bottlenecks/Regulatory Actions): Based on factory output, FDA/regulatory warnings, or production line failures.
•	Examples: "+2: New plant fully operational", "-2: FDA warning letter received, production halted".
4. Human Capital Dynamics
•	Definition: "The ability to attract and retain necessary talent at sustainable wage levels, maintaining a stable and motivated workforce."
•	Classify on a scale from +2 (High retention/Stable costs) to -2 (High attrition/Wage inflation): Based on hiring challenges, staff turnover, or salary cost pressure.
•	Examples: "+2: Successful hiring of R&D team", "-2: High attrition in sales force, wage inflation pressure".
5. Demand Patterns & Volume
•	Definition: "Customer demand is organic, sustainable, and growing, without reliance on temporary surges (e.g., pandemic spikes) or artificial stocking."
•	Classify on a scale from +2 (Accelerating/Organic Growth) to -2 (Deceleration/Destocking): Based on order intake, book-to-bill ratios, and normalization of demand.
•	Examples: "+2: Strong organic demand across all regions", "-2: Customers destocking, significant drop in COVID-related revenues".
6. Pricing Power & Profitability
•	Definition: "The ability to maintain or expand margins by passing on input costs to customers through price increases without losing volume."
•	Classify on a scale from +2 (Strong Pricing Power/Margin Expansion) to -2 (Margin Compression/Inability to Price): Based on gross margin discussions, OPEX absorption, and pricing strategies.
•	Examples: "+2: Price increases fully offset inflation", "-2: Margins squeezed by marketing spend and raw material costs".
7. Strategic Execution & Brand Health
•	Definition: "Long-term strategic initiatives (M&A, Innovation, Brand positioning) are delivering expected value and maintaining market exclusivity."
•	Classify on a scale from +2 (Successful Integration/Strong Brand) to -2 (Integration Failure/Brand Dilution): Based on M&A synergies, product launch success, or competitive threats.
•	Examples: "+2: Integration exceeding expectations", "-2: Delays in new platform launch, competition eroding market share".


    Rules:
    - If uncertainty or no mention, classify as 0.
    - Output MUST be a single line of comma-separated values representing drivers 1 through 7.
    - No markdown, no text explanations, JUST the numbers.
    - Your driver scores should align with and support the overall stability score of {stability_score}.
    
    Task: For each driver (1-7), classify the level from -2 to +2. Limit your response to the following comma-separated format representing drivers 1 through 7: Example Output: -2, -1, 0, +1, -2, 0, +2

    Example Output: -2, -1, 0, +1, -2, 0, +2
